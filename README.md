# Who said it - game

This is a Game built with React. As I am studying I have found the useRef hook so I challenged myself to develop a little and funny game. The useRef hook was an excuse. I have use it to check if the answer in a specific input is correct or wrong. So please welcome and try my game. 
PS: If you are a Breaking Bad fan you can test how much you know about the show...
